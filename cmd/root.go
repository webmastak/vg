const noEvalError = `You haven't eval-ed "vg eval" yet.

Usually this is caused by one of the following two options:
- You have not run "vg setup" yet.
- You have not restarted your terminal/IDE after running "vg setup"

If you have done both it probably means that your "~/.bashrc" file is not being
executed on startup by bash. This usually caused by your terminal running
"~/.profile" at startup instead of running "~/.bashrc". The easiest way to fix
this is by placing the following at the top of your "~/.profile" file (if
"~/.profile does not exist you should add this in "~/.bash_profile"):

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi

Virtualgo (or vg for short) is a tool which provides easy and powerful
workspace based development for Go. The vendor directory provides something
similar. However, virtualgo adds features that are either broken or
fully missing when using a vendor directory.

Below is an example of the 'vg' command in action. For more info see detailed
command info at 'vg help <command>' or look at the README on Github:
https://github.com/webmastak/vg/blob/master/README.md

To start using virtualgo for a project run the following:

	$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Getstream/example
	$ vg init  # initial creation of workspace

Now all commands will be executed from within the example workspace

	(example) $ go get github.com/pkg/errors # package only present in workspace
	(example) $ vg ensure  # installs the dependencies of the example project using dep
	(example) $ vg deactivate

If you cd back into the project the workspace is now activated automatically

	$ cd ~
	$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Getstream/example
	(example) $ 

See the README on Github for more info
